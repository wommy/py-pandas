advanced-bud-candy-1l,Advanced Nutrients - Bud Candy,"<h4>Information</h4>
<p><strong>FEED SUGARS, AMINOS AND VITAMINS TO YOUR PLANTS AND TASTE THEIR SWEETER, BIGGER BUDS</strong></p>
<p>If I asked you what really makes you happy about your hydroponics gardening, you'd tell me you love growing huge amounts of potent, sweet-tasting flowers.</p>
<p>Seeing your roomful of huge flowers that smell like candy (maybe like the cotton candy at an amusement park), and then after harvest you savor that fine taste, aroma and potency with your friends.</p>
<p>The smiles on their faces, and them patting you on the back, that's what the good life is all about.</p>
<p>So the big question is, what can you do right now to grow yourself the biggest harvests of the most potent, best-tasting flowers?</p>
<p><strong>START BY PROVIDING FLOWER-BOOSTING ENERGY WHEN YOUR PLANTS MOST NEED IT</strong></p>
<p>Getting sweeter, bigger harvests comes when you give your plants carbohydrates that jolt them with an energy boost.</p>
<p>This is an important fact to remember, that during peak bloom cycle your plants' need for sugars exceeds their ability to manufacture sugars. The more you push them, the more C02 and nutrients you give them, the more they need carbos, the more they fall behind.</p>
<p>The resulting carbo deficit is the same thing that happens when athletes collapse near the end of grueling competition. And it's why carboloading is a favorite tactic athletes use to keep going strong for victory, when others fall and fail.</p>
<p><strong>NOT JUST ANY CARBOHYDRATES, BUT THE RIGHT ONES FOR YOUR PLANTS</strong></p>
<p>Carboloading your plants requires a specialty formula. In actuality, your plants best absorb simple or complex carbohydrates when they are present as Arabinose, Dextrose, Glucose, Maltose and Xylose from Raw Cane Extract, Malt Extract, Cranberry Extract and other premium carbohydrate sources.</p>
<p>Not only does this end mid-bloom slump but these materials fuel beneficial bacteria and fungi in your root zone.</p>
<p>When you've installed beneficial bacteria and fungi in your root zone, they thrive best when they have externally-provided carbos to feed on.</p>
<p>Beneficial bacteria and fungi increase root mass, increase nutrient absorption, protect roots, and produce hormones that stimulate floral size, potency and value.</p>
<p>So now that you've seen how to use the right kinds of carbos to provide energy and root enhancement, what else can you do to create gourmet flowers with enhanced taste, size, potency, and aroma?</p>
<p>As it turns out, by providing the list of carbo sources we just discussed, you're also enhancing the taste and aroma of your plants.</p>
<p><strong>THE BENEFITS OF USING AMINO ACIDS AND OTHER COMPOUNDS IN THE CORRECT FORM FOR YOUR PLANTS</strong></p>
<p>Here's something else to keep in mind: the advantages provided by what you feed your crops depends on the quality of specific ingredients in the products.</p>
<p>For example, you see hydroponics formulas that contain ""molasses."" But as with almost every individual ingredient in hydroponics formulas, there are many grades and types of molasses, and the differences between them decide whether they will deliver your bigger, better yields.</p>
<p>Fact is, most types of molasses are loaded with sulphur or made from materials or processes that lower their sugar content and quality.</p>
<p>When sulphured, low-grade molasses are in a hydroponics formula, its extraneous minerals throw off your nutrient ratios while providing smaller percentages of sugars.</p>
<p>Now take a minute and let me show you how this relates to the types and forms of amino acids in hydroponics formulas.</p>
<p>Amino acids are crucial building blocks for proteins that fuel metabolic processes and physical structure in your flowering plants. Few hydroponics formulas contain amino acids, but almost all the ones that have aminos provide them in a form called ""D-Aminos.""</p>
<p>Although these aminos are cheaper to source and manufacture, they unfortunately are not very helpful to your plants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the L-form of amino acids is totally biologically available for rapid uptake and formation of proteins that rapidly increase your crop health and yield.</p>
<p>As with molasses and other ingredients in hydroponics formulas, it matters a lot what forms and manufacturing processes are used.</p>
<p><strong>SWEETER FLOWERS ARE WORTH MORE</strong></p>
<p>Sweeter flowers are yours when you boost your crop's taste, potency and aroma by furnishing anthocyanins, isoflavonoids, polyphenols, isoterpenes and tannins found in cranberry and grape extracts.</p>
<p>Growers using these compounds report that a sudden bouquet of pleasant scent arises from their flowers within moments of the compounds being fed to plants in water.</p>
<p>And after harvest, you and your friends will enjoy the extra-sweet aroma and taste that your flowers provide, and there'll be more flowers to enjoy too.</p>
<p>Another technique for upgrading the aroma, taste and value of your crop is to feed vitamins to your plants.</p>
<p>For example, Vitamin C stimulates photosynthesis and cell replication while also protecting your plants from negative effects of intense light and heat. To go along with Vitamin C, studies show that feeding your plants B vitamins provides many flower-boosting benefits while also protecting crops from stress.</p>
<p>So how can you get this extensive menu of crop-boosting compounds you've just found out about? Fortunately, Advanced Nutrients scientists have successfully managed the complex task of sourcing, processing, and combining all these aminos, carbs, and vitamins so Bud Candy delivers bigger, sweeter buds to you right away.</p>
<p>Best of all, you're getting two products in one because Bud Candy gives you everything in Sweet Leaf and CarboLoad, but it also gives you a lot more in an easy to use formula.</p>
<p>Whether your plants are in bloom phase right now, or you're preparing for bloom phase, this is the time to procure 100% organic Bud Candy and get cotton candy taste, fatter buds, and stronger plants.</p>",Advanced Nutrients,"","advanced-nutrients, nutrients",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,0,deny,manual,33.00,,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0417/5675/4069/products/advanced-nutrients-advanced-bud-candy-1l.png?v=1597727704,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kg,,,active

Next to adding CANNABOOST to the substrate it can also be used as a leaf spray (foliar feeding). Fuller, Quality taste With CANNABOOST, you should expect an exceptional taste. A good harvest isnâ€™t just expressed in terms of weight these days. Quality is starting to play a more important role and this also means taste is becoming more important. Optimal photosynthesis will insure the highest potential carbohydrate production in fruits.</div>

nanolux-ledex-track-2,Nanolux - LEDex Track - 2',"<h4>Information</h4>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8PWeKS8NK4"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>Nanolux LEDex Series Fixtures are designed for full-cycle commercial cultivation that features many advantages compared with traditional light sources, bringing new efﬁciencies for your grow facility that weren’t possible before. This technology is revolutionizing the horticultural lighting industry in both lowering electric usage and increasing overall crop yield.</p>
<p>Nanolux distributes the 110W bars individually in case quantities. This allows you to utilize only the number of light bars as needed per track to meet your over all required PPFD on your canopy. The individual LED bars can also be used individually for side or intra-canopy lighting without the track.</p>
<p>Nanolux has designed its LED ﬁxture around a modular concept. We sell tracks in 2’, 4’ and 8’ lengths. The tracks are designed for the 2’ track to accept 2-4 bars, the 4’ track to accept 4-8 bars and the 8’ track to accept 8-16 bars. This allows the end user to be able to adjust the overall light intensity over the canopy area and allows for greater ability to raise and lower the light over the canopy while maintaining a desired umol count.</p>
<p>Nanolux has designed ﬁve different bars with ﬁve different speciﬁc light frequency outputs. Full white, Blue, Blue/Red, Red and UV. This allows the end user to mix for white light with speciﬁc frequencies to aid in vegetative and ﬂower growth.</p>
<p>LEDex Series ﬁxtures allow random start, soft start, soft dimming capabilities, and feature over temperature protection, under voltage protection and open / short circuit protection. It is 0-10V COMPATIBLE, allowing control of your lighting with 0-10V protocol. The units can be used at any voltage range between 100-277 volts.</p>",Nanolux,"",Grow Lights,true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,0,deny,manual,87.00,,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0417/5675/4069/products/nanolux-nanolux-ledex-track-2.jpg?v=1597643956,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kg,,,active

<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The NextLight Core is a full spectrum bright white LED grow light. We harnessed the same high intensity light of the NextLight Mega and redesigned it for use in smaller spaces. The NextLight Core is an enhanced version of its predecessor, the NextLight Mini. Boasting a 50% increase in light output and using only 190 watts, this light is perfect for small tents and any space where venting and air conditioning is an issue.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Core covers a 3 ft x 3 ft flower footprint and a 4 ft x 4 ft veg footprint. This unit is part of the NextLight Commercial Series. This distinction means each unit is covered by a 5 year full manufacturerâ€™s warranty, has a 100,000 hour life rating, is UL listed and you will never have to change a bulb again.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Core is designed to meet the needs of commercial and home growers alike. We understand excessive power consumption, bulb replacements and heat are the biggest problems indoor growers face. The NextLight Commercial Series alleviates all of those issues. The Core is extremely efficient coming in at 2.0 PPF/Watt,Â  Â </p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">NextLightâ€™s Full Spectrum provides the same sun-like qualities plants love without the negatives of high energy requirements and high heat. Using NextLightâ€™s Full Spectrum you will see faster growth, tighter internodal spacing and increased production overall.</p>

<p> Purple Cow Organics Activated Compost With MicroLife is a scientifically formulated, tested, and certified premium compost - vermicompost based product. It delivers a full-range of benefits, along with metabolic building blocks to enrich and enliven your soil's foodweb. Purple Cow is formulated beginning with composted leaves and alfalfa fiber. Alfalfa contains a naturally-occurring plant hormone; triacontanol, that research has proven to promote root growth. During the composting process of Purple Cow, beneficial ""soil foods"", including greensand, rock dusts, and kelp meal stimulate a diversity of microorganisms along with adding macro and micronutrients. Kelp contains growth hormones, auxins, cytokines, and gibberellins, which increase root development substantially. Finally, MicroLife, Purple Cow's own blend of vermicompost worm castings, is added for final activation of the product. Purple Cow supplies beneficial microorganisms and organic humus to the growing media of soil, harmoniously enhancing your soil's biology and making nutrients more available for plant uptake. Purple Cow improves soil structure and porosity, creating a better plant root environment, resulting in a healthier plant overall.</p>

<p>CANNA Terra Professional Plus formula was developed to fulfill the desire of creating the purest soil mix possible and to obtain the best effects with CANNA TERRA nutrients.</p>
<p>CANNA Terra Professional Plus is made up from raw materials each of the highest quality. Exclusive, high grade ingredients such as airy peat moss and different types of tree bark (as a substitute for perlite) are components of CANNA Terra Professional Plus. They have an antiseptic effect and increase aeration qualities. This has a direct result in promoting exceptional root development and formation of thicker stems, while faster metabolism combined with low sickness rates ensure an increased production.</p>
<p>CANNA Terra Professional Plus is enriched with special feeding mixes, containing all the elements plants need during their first week, meaning no additional feeding is needed at that time! The medium is also pH-adjusted for long-term control with a lime charge large enough to last an entire cycle. It has a mineral-nutrient starter charge that adjusts the initial level of nutrients up to a good beginning charge, correcting the ratios to work perfectly with CANNA TERRA nutrients.</p>

<div class=""page info active"">The Chikamasa B-500SRF are curved, stainless steel blades with a fluorine coating. Fluorine makes the blades on the Chikamasa B-500SRF sap resistant. A curved tip allows you to reach hard-to-manage places. The outside edges of these Japanese-steel blades are grounded round, a first for Chikamasa. Rounded edges on scissors protect the grain of the flower, grape or other agricultural commodity youâ€™re pruning from bruising or other damage as you work. The B-500 series is the newest non-spring scissor from Chikamasa, designed specifically for thriving and ever-expanding agriculture growers in the USA. Chikamasa combines knowledge from the ancient art of bonsai trimming with the needs of modern consumer agriculture. The result is a line of specialized garden scissors ideal for long hours of cutting and pruning in the field or chair.</div>

turbo-klone-t48-system,Turbo Klone - T48 System,"<h4 class=""body""><span>Information</span></h4>
<div class=""body""><span></span></div>
<div class=""body""><span><big>The TurboKlone gives you a stronger, longer-lasting product thanks to its smart design and use of innovative technology.</big></span></div>
<div class=""body""><span><br></span></div>
<div class=""body"">The fan system [patent application in process] provides constant oxygen to the growing chamber and, most importantly, combats high temperatures by circulating cool air throughout the unit. The innovative fan system fits like a glove on the side of the reservoir—keeping the unit free from dangling parts and tangling cords like other systems on the market.</div>
<div class=""body"">
<p class=""maincontent""><img src=""https://www.altgarden.com/store/secure/uploads/picture-2.jpg"" alt=""""></p>
<p><span>The central technology behind TurboKlone is simple:  A fan that offers a one-two punch!</span></p>
<p><span><span class=""center1""><strong>1. The fan blows fresh air into the growing chamber</strong> <br><strong>2. The cool air from the fan keeps temperatures low</strong></span></span></p>
<p class=""maincontent""><span><strong>AHEAD OF THE CURVE</strong><br>While other cloning machines are designed with straight lines and angles that resemble <br>storage containers and planter boxes, the Turbo Klone has sleek, rounded edges and curved<br>walls that give it greater strength and resilience from external and internal forces.</span></p>
<p class=""maincontent""><span>And those curves aren't just for good looks!  Its sleek, rounded design makes cleaning the<br>Turbo Klone a breeze!  You don't have to worry about bacteria hanging around in tight corners.</span></p>
<p class=""maincontent""><span><strong>MORE IS BETTER</strong><br>Why settle for less when you can have more.  Klone sites that is!  Turbo Klone's T48 gives<br>you 48 clone sites—60% more than other systems on the market.  The best part?  You get<br>more sites without taking up more space!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Turbo Klone Revolution gives you what other clone machines on the market aren't giving you.</span></strong><span><br></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>SITES</strong>:  Why have less when you can have more?  Turbo Klone gives you up to 60% more sites in the same amount of space than other machines.  Why pay more when you can pay less?  It'll cost you just $6.25 per site with the T48 and nearly $10.40 per site for a machine of similar size.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span><strong>STRUCTURE/CLEANING</strong>:  Instead of having flat walls like a Tupperware tub, the Turbo Klone is curvy and has rounded edges giving you a stronger, more durable product.  Bonus!  Those sexy curves also let you clean the system quickly and easily. You don't have to worry about unwanted root-killing bacteria hanging around in tight corners.</span><span> </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>CONVENIENCE/FUNCTIONALITY</strong>:  Each Klone site has a finger recess that makes it easy to remove and replace Klone Collars.   And we've taken the guess-work out of water measurements by adding a fill-line inside the tub so you always know how much H2O you need to add.  You're welcome!</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span><strong>CONTROL/OPTIONS</strong>:  Seems like there are two camps when it comes to using a humidity dome: some say it isn't necessary, others say they wouldn't clone without it – especially in the first five days.  We let you make the call.  You can purchase our cloning systems with-or-without a humidity dome.  And if you have buyers remorse, you can always buy the dome by itself later.  It's nice to be in charge!</span> </li>
</ul>

<p><span>One of the most effective rooting hormones available. Propagators at nurseries and universities nationwide have increased their yields and found Dip'N Grow™ to be more economical and easier to use than other rooting agents. Dip'N Grow™ is a liquid concentrate (1:10 ratio standard) that is easily diluted with water to the necessary strength. With the new dilution cup available in the rooting kits, it has never been easier to have precise dilution. Dip'N Grow™ contains two rooting auxins (plant hormones Indole-3 butric acid and Naphthaleneacetic acid) recognized as root-inducing. Because alcohol is used as the solvent for the active ingredients, Dip'N Grow™ is self sanitizing so cross-contamination problems are eliminated.</span></p>",Astoria,"",plant-propagation-and-seed,true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,0,deny,manual,11.49,,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0417/5675/4069/products/dipn-grow-2-oz-rooting-kit.jpg?v=1597395650,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kg,,,active

<p><strong>This 1 ft. height extension kit<span> </span></strong>gives you the ability to increase your growing height from 6’7″ to 7’7″.</p>
<p>Benefits to raising the roof include:</p>
<p>1. Significant Yield Increase – More usable growing height allows you to cultivate larger plants.  Larger plants produce larger quantities of fruits and flowers.</p>
<p>2.  Getting the party started.</p>
<p>3.  Stable, Ideal Temperature Around Plants – Heat rises.  With the additional height this kit provides, your heat will stay up by the lights where you want it, and more importantly, away from your precious plants.  What does this mean for you?  It means that your plants will produce more densely and fully with tighter fruit and pod bundling, and elicit a greater flavor and nose.  This all equates to BETTER QUALITY YIELDS!</p>
<p>4. Stand-Up Maintenance – SAVE YOUR BACK!  Place your plants on a table.  With the significant increase in height, you can now still have ample growing space.  Ease your personal wear and tear without compromising your results.</p>
<p>If you have the height, why not use it?!</p>
<p>After all, size DOES matter.</p>

10x20ext,Gorilla Grow -GORILLA GROW TENT - 2' EXTENSION - 10' x 20' - OG/SHORTY,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
PLEASE SELECT THE CORRECT SIZE BEFORE PLACING YOUR ORDER
Every Gorilla Grow Tent already includes a complimentary height extension kit that gives you the ability to increase your growing height from 7′ to 8′.

With this 2 foot height extension it you will now gain the ability to have a tent that is 8′, 9′, or even 10′ in height, by using either just the 1′ kit or the 2′ kit, or combining them to make the ABSOLUTE TALLEST GROW TENT KNOWN TO MANKIND!!!

Benefits to raising the roof include:

1. Significant Yield Increase – More usable growing height allows you to cultivate larger plants.  Larger plants produce larger quantities of fruits and flowers.

2.  Getting the party started.

3.  Stable, Ideal Temperature Around Plants – Heat rises.  With the additional height this kit provides, your heat will stay up by the lights where you want it, and more importantly, away from your precious plants.  What does this mean for you?  It means that your plants will produce more densely and fully with tighter fruit and pod bundling, and elicit a greater flavor and nose.  This all equates to BETTER QUALITY YIELDS!

4. Stand-Up Maintenance – SAVE YOUR BACK!  Place your plants on a table.  With the significant increase in height, you can now still have ample growing space.  Ease your personal wear and tear without compromising your results.

If you have the height, why not use it?!

After all, size DOES matter.

Thanks to Gorilla Grow Tent, you won’t just be growing an indoor garden, you’ll be creating an indoor forest!!

PLEASE SELECT THE CORRECT SIZE BEFORE PLACING YOUR ORDER
Every Gorilla Grow Tent already includes a complimentary height extension kit that gives you the ability to increase your growing height from 7′ to 8′.

With this 2 foot height extension it you will now gain the ability to have a tent that is 8′, 9′, or even 10′ in height, by using either just the 1′ kit or the 2′ kit, or combining them to make the ABSOLUTE TALLEST GROW TENT KNOWN TO MANKIND!!!

Benefits to raising the roof include:

1. Significant Yield Increase – More usable growing height allows you to cultivate larger plants.  Larger plants produce larger quantities of fruits and flowers.

2.  Getting the party started.

3.  Stable, Ideal Temperature Around Plants – Heat rises.  With the additional height this kit provides, your heat will stay up by the lights where you want it, and more importantly, away from your precious plants.  What does this mean for you?  It means that your plants will produce more densely and fully with tighter fruit and pod bundling, and elicit a greater flavor and nose.  This all equates to BETTER QUALITY YIELDS!

4. Stand-Up Maintenance – SAVE YOUR BACK!  Place your plants on a table.  With the significant increase in height, you can now still have ample growing space.  Ease your personal wear and tear without compromising your results.

If you have the height, why not use it?!

After all, size DOES matter.

Thanks to Gorilla Grow Tent, you won’t just be growing an indoor garden, you’ll be creating an indoor forest!!

dip-n-grow-liquid-rooting-concentrate,Dip'N Grow - Liquid Rooting Concentrate,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>Dip N Grow is a cloning solution that is self sanitizing due to its alcohol content, eliminating cross contamination. You'll have more success than with a powder.</p>
<p>For use on ornamentals only. Mix only for immediate use. For best results once diluted, Dip 'N Grow should be used within 10 hours. Read and follow the directions for use and precautionary statements printed on the bottle. This product is intended for commercial use only. Applicators and other handlers must wear: long-sleeved shirt and long pants, chemical resistant gloves, such as barrier laminate, butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, neoprene rubber, polyvinyl chloride, or viton, and shoes plus socks.</p>
<p>Dip'N Grow™ contains two rooting auxins (plant hormones Indole-3 butric acid and Naphthaleneacetic acid) recognized as root-inducing.</p>
<p>Directions for using the dilution cup: As soon as possible after taking cuttings, prepare a dilute solution of Dip 'N Grow as follows: To avoid spilling, use scissors to cut the corner of the 0.2 ounce packet and carefully pour Dip 'N Grow into the dilution cup, or pour from the 2 ounce bottle to the concentrate line of the dilution cup supplied.</p>
<p>For hardwoods, add water to the 5X dilution line. For semi-hardwoods, add water to the 10X dilution line. For softwoods or succulents, add water to the 20X dilution line. If you are doing more than one type of cutting start with the hardwoods so that you may dilute the solution to a semi-hardwood or a softwood dilution level later. Dip the basal end (bottom) of the cutting approximately one inch into the dilute Dip 'N Grow for 3 to 5 seconds. Following dipping, place cuttings into planting medium. (Vermiculite, perlite, pumice, or any coarse planting medium that drains well, works best).</p>
<p>Dip 'N Grow is available in a 2 ounce kit and a 16 ounce resealable bottle.</p>

titan-controls-saturn-4-environmental-controller,Titan Controls - Saturn 4 Environmental Controller,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>The Saturn™ 4 Environmental Controller by Titan Controls is a basic environmental controller that enables the user to control desired temperature and humidity settings, operate a carbon dioxide (CO2) controller, an exhaust fan, and a dehumidifier. The Saturn™ 4 can also operate a device that operates only when it's dark</p>
<p>The Saturn™ 4 Environmental Controller features digitally precise and easy to use knobs that dial in the desired temperature and humidity settings. So simple, a single button allows you to change between three different operating modes. Comes with a 15-foot long remote sensor and a photocell for nighttime control. High-impact plastic enclosure protects internal components from dust, rust and moisture.</p>
<p>The Saturn™ 4 has three independent operating modes. The selection depends on the type of devices being connected to the controller. Press the Select Mode button to change from MODE A, B or C. A green LED will let you know what MODE you are operating in.</p>
<p>Mode A: This mode independently lowers your temperature and humidity. If you are connecting a cooling device (such as a exhaust fan) to lower the temperature AND a dehumidifier to lower the humidity level, the controller will activate these devices independently based on the temperature and humidity levels in your grow room and your preferred set points. The ‘Cooling Output’ is activated when the temperature set point is exceeded and the ‘Humid/Dehumid Output’ is activated when the humidity set point is exceeded.</p>
<p>Mode B: This mode simultaneously lowers your temperature and humidity. If you are connecting a cooling device (such as an exhaust fan) to lower your temperature AND a dehumidifier to lower the humidity levels, the controller will activate the devices simultaneously if the temperature rises above the set point AND/OR the humidity level rises above the set point. The ‘Cooling Output’ and ‘Humid/Dehumid Output” will both be activated until both the temperature and/or humidity set point is reached.</p>
<p>Mode C: This mode independently lowers the temperature and increases the humidity. If you’re connecting a cooling device (such as a fan) to lower your temperature AND a humidifier to raise the humidity level, the controller will activate these devices independently based on the temperature and humidity levels in your grow room and your preferred set points. The ‘Cooling Output’ is activated when the temperature set point is exceeded, and the ‘Humid/Dehumid Output’ is activated when the humidity set point is exceeded.</p>
<p>The Saturn™ 4 Environmental Controller measures 9 inches tall by 7 inches wide by 3 and 3/4 inches deep. Humidity control range between 5% and 95% non-condensing relative humidity (RH) with an accuracy of +/- 3% RH of desired setting. Temperature control settings range between 41 degrees F. and 113 degrees with an accuracy of +/- 1 degree F.

<p>The Flora Series of hydroponic fertilizers from General Hydroponics, including FloraGro (2-1-6), FloraBloom(0-5-4), and FloraMicro (5-0-1), represents the collective contribution of many famous scientists in the fields of hydroponics, agriculture, and chemistry. The concept behind the Flora Series is the ability to mix three different products into a huge range of different nutrient solutions.</p>
<p>The needs of practically any type of plant at each different stage in its life cycle can be satisfied by varying the combinations and overall strength of the mix. Think of it as changing flavor by mixing different ratios of FloraGro, FloraBloom, and FloraMicro, and different nutrient strengths by varying the amount of water with which they are blended. This gives the grower three-dimensional control over the nutrient. The Flora-series is the most popular hydroponic fertilizer in the world. For mixing, try the 1, 2, 3 method.</p>

<p>Conductivity (measured in ppm, EC, TDS, CF) is the total soluble salts contained within a liquid solution.</p>

<p>Pure water does not contain salts, so it has a conductivity measurement of zero. By adding soluble elements(fertilizers or other additives) to the water, electricity is able to move through the solution giving it a conductivity rating. This gives you a relative strength of the solution you are giving to your plants.</p>

<p>Controlling this nutrient strength is all important in providing the best conditions for your crop. Without proper measurement your crop could fail from root burn brought on by too high a nutrient level, or death by natural causes from not receiving the vital elements they need to grow.</p>

<p>Different crops grow well at different levels of nutrient strength. It is important to control the nutrient strength to provide the conditions in the root zone which provide maximum uptake of balanced nutrition into the plant, while minimising stress.</p>

<p>For each crop there is a range in which the nutrient strength is optimal, providing enough nutrient for growth, but not so strong that the concentration of salts in the plant gets too high. Electronic meters are available to measure the conductivity of the nutrient solution.</p>

<p>The Bluelab Truncheon measures the nutrient strength of your solution. It is essential when growing hydroponics to KNOW what the strength of the solution is before feeding your plants AND while they are growing. It employs a highly sophisticated microprocessor chip and temperature-compensated sensor, which results in very accurate EC, PPM, and CF Readings. To take a reading of your solution - simply place the probe head into the solution for 1-2 minutes to reach the same temperature of your nutrient. Remove from the solution and place back in to take the reading as indicated by the flashing lights. Rinse the probe after use in fresh water and clean once a week to ensure the Truncheon remains accurate. It's great for stirring your nutrient tank too! Main Features - EC (0.2 - 3.6), CF (2 - 36), PPM scales (TDS and 700 scale) - Fully waterproof - Factory calibrated (never needs to be re-calibrated) - Auto sense on and off - No external switches or adjustable buttons - Battery life minimum 1 year (or shelf life of battery) - Runs on three AA alkaline batteries - Comes with a 5 year Bluelab Guarantee - Accurate within +/- 4% of reading</p>

<p>The Bluelab pH Pen is the latest innovation for hand held pH meters and is the ultimate handy solution for measuring pH.</p>

<p>Hydroponic growing lets you give the best care possible to your plants. The quality of care is in your control.</p>

<p>The Bluelab pH Pen provides a compact, quick and handy way to manage the success of your crops to ensure maximum uptake of nutrients.</p>

<p>Why is measuring pH vital to the success of your crop?</p>

<p>Plants eat. They get their nutrition from minerals but they can only get all the minerals they need if certain conditions are right. A key thing that affects food uptake is whether your solution is acid or alkaline. We measure this in pH. The clever little pH pen ensures you maintain the optimum pH reading that allows nutrients to be available to your plants.</p>

<p>General Hydroponics pH Down Concentrate keeps your nutrient solution at the optimum pH level to ensure the best possible nutrient uptake by your plants.</p>
<p>For plants to grow their best, it's important that the nutrient pH be slightly acidic. A range between 5.5 and 6.5 is considered ideal for most crops. General Hydroponics' pH Down Concentrate is made with phosphoric acid. There are many pH down products on the market, but you get more bang for your buck with GH's pH Down. Use sparingly, a little goes a long way.

canna-pk-13-14,CANNA - PK 13/14,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>Increases yields

CANNA PK 13/14 is a mixture of top quality nutritional minerals that stimulate flowering. This product has been developed for the flowering phase of fast growing plants. PK 13/14 is easy to use and high yields are easily achieved.</p>

<p>Pure elements to stimulate flowering

PK 13/14 is a high grade mixture of phosphorus and potassium that is added during the flowering phase. Both elements play a big role during the flowering phase of fast growing plants. Thanks to a special production process CANNA has succeeded in combining pure phosphorous and potassium in very high concentrations and this makes PK 13/14 available to the plant quickly and directly.</p>

<p>Phosphorous (P) is a major nutritional element for every plant. It plays a key role in metabolism and energy transfer. Extra phosphorous is needed in the flowering phase. Phosphorous strengthens cell formation in flowers among other things.

Potassium (K) is found throughout the plant and is necessary for a lot of its activities. It is essential for transporting water and nutrition (sieve vessels) and it is responsible for the plant’s quality and rigidity. In addition to this it controls countless other processes such as sugar production. Potassium ensures that the plant can produce enough sugars during flowering, which are essential for the development of the flowers.</p>

<p>Lavish flowering

There comes a moment during the plant’s development when the need for phosphorous and potassium increases greatly. If CANNA PK 13/14 is given at this moment you will satisfy the flowering plant’s increased needs and the fruits will achieve maximum development. CANNA BOOST enhances the metabolism and has a strengthening effect on PK 13/14. This perfect combination will cause the plant to fl ower more lavishly.</p>
<p>Suitable for every medium

PK 13/14 is used with every medium and consequently it is used for cultivation on soil, in recirculatory systems, when cultivating on coco and in run-to-waste systems. PK 13/14 is suitable for use when cultivating both indoors and outdoors. When Canna began sales in North America, PK 13/14 used the standard European way of expressing percentages of the nutrients in fertilizer as volume/ volume (milliliters/ liter). It was after arriving on the shelf in NA that we had to change to the North American convention of using Mass/ mass (milligrams/ kilograms). So, to satisfy the regulatory powers, we are required to state the mass percentages of the contents of PK thus the additional numbers 0 - 10 - 11. Same fine product, just a different way of stating the percentages of the nutrients as 0 - 10 - 11 in mass percentages is exactly the same as 0 - 13 - 14 in volume percentages.</p>

canna-boost,CANNA - BOOST,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>Fuller, harder fruits

CANNABOOST is CANNA’s powerful flowering stimulator. Specially developed for fast growing plants, it improves quality and increases yields. CANNABOOST stimulates the development of newly formed flowers which ultimately results in fuller fruits. This also leads to a more homogeneous harvest because the fruits mature evenly. Something very special about CANNABOOST is that it does not only assure excellent yields, but also better taste, a little something extra for the CANNA grower.</p>

<p>Suitable for every substrate

CANNABOOST is a universal flowering stimulant; this means it can be used in every cultivation system and in combination with every kind of feeding without exception. Originally designed for tank mixing with the nutrient solution, CANNBOOST can also be used as a foliar spray. The advantage of this is that the plant can absorb this flowering stimulant directly through the leaves. Combines perfectly with PK 13/14 CANNABOOST increases the plant’s photosynthesis. This increase assures that fruits form more quickly, so the availability of nutrients is very important for achieving optimum results with CANNABOOST. CANNA feeding guarantees the availability of all these nutrients, PK13/14 added to the CANNA feeding provide even better results. This is because PK 13/14 provides the plant with extra flowering elements while CANNABOOST assures the plant has the energy to utilize these elements.</p>

<p>Better maturing and protection

CANNABOOST contains flowering compounds that assure the plant matures to its full potential. It also holds natural flowering regulators that better distribute both stimulants in the booster itself, as well as flowering substances and energy naturally available in the plant. This enables the fruits to develop more uniformly and to mature to their full potential. Thanks to the improved energy regulation, the plant also has sufficient energy available to resist pathogens. If energy is lacking when and where it is needed, then disease will often strike usually when it will be most disastrous for the harvest.</p>

<p>Better, stronger taste

A successful and good harvest is not only judged on quantities nowadays. Quality is starting to play an even more important role and taste is one of the indicators for it. CANNABOOST does not just assure higher yields, but also excellent flavor. It encourages the photosynthesis process within the plant, which increases sugar production in the fruits. This gives a much sweeter taste and enhances the concentration of natural flavors being produced by the plant itself.</p>

copy-of-canna-rhizotonic,CANNA - CANNAZYM,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>CANNAZYM CANNAZYM is a high-quality enzyme product. It consists of more than 12 different kinds of enzymes to which vitamins and extracts of desert plants are added. CANNAZYM speeds up the process of breaking down dead root material and activates the micro-organisms. In addition to this, CANNAZYM facilitates the improved absorption of nutrients and increases the resistance against pathogenic organisms.</p>

<p>The threat

In a root system that functions well, roots die and new roots are formed. The remains of roots that died form an ideal growing substrate for pathogenic organisms. After the pathogenic moulds have multiplied in the dead root material, they are a threat to the healthy roots. These are easily affected, and will lose an important part of their function. This causes stress to the entire plant and stunts any new growth.</p>

<p>How does CANNAZYM work?

Enzymes are substances that speed up the reactions in living organisms. (Example: enzymes play a vital role in our digestion). The enzymes in CANNAZYM facilitate fast conversion of dead roots into minerals and sugars. This is important, as they make up a valuable source of nutrients for the plant as well as for the soil environment. A fast breakdown of root remains creates a balanced air and soil hydrology in the root environment. Furthermore, putrefaction and consequently the formation of toxic substances are prevented and the risk of an infection by pathogenic moulds is considerably reduced. This is ideal for your plant. The soil environment is improved, as the minerals and sugars that are formed as a result of using CANNAZYM, are important for the bacteria located close to the roots. These bacteria provide the plant with extra protection against diseases that are caused by moulds and facilitate the exchange nutrients and vitamins with the roots. This results in improved balance and an increased absorption capacity.</p>

<p>Increased health

CANNAZYM contains several easy-to-absorb vitamins that stimulate the plant to form new roots. A well-developed root system uses of a lot of young growing-points. Elements like calcium, magnesium and iron are absorbed exactly by these growing-points. Furthermore, a substance that has been isolated from desert plants has been added to CANNAZYM, as a result of which the plant’s natural defence system will be improved. Activation of the defence system of the plant increases the protection against pathogenic organisms. A defence system that functions optimally allows the plant to react quickly against an imminent attack; eventual damage will be prevented or limited. The above-mentioned information also explains why CANNAZYM is indispensable with the reuse of growing substrates; the root remains will be rapidly broken down and transformed into advantageous nutrients; infections will be prevented and the air/water relation in the root environment will be improved.</p>

canna-aqua-flores,CANNA - AQUA-FLORES,"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>Get the Canna Coco Feed Chart</p>
<p>CANNA Aqua is the nutrient that has been specifically developed for the use in combination closed hydroponic systems, like NFT or Bubbler systems. With these systems the drainage water isn’t removed but is reused. In this sort of system the plants are in direct contact with the nutrient solution. Because the plants do not absorb all the nutritional elements with equal speed or in equal amounts, the composition of the nutrient solution changes over time.</p>

<p>CANNA Aqua has been developed in such a way as to ensure that the plants can always absorb the correct combination of nutritional elements that are necessary for optimum growth and bloom. The formula is made up so the plants regulate the pH themselves so that the pH in the nutrient tank always remains within the optimum pH range. This means that having once set the correct starting pH no further correction is necessary.</p>

<p>In this way CANNA makes one of the most complex cultivation systems considerably easier for the grower.</p>

<p>There's a reason the majority of growers in the UK, a country where this cultivation method is extremely popular, use CANNA Aqua.</p>

<p>Available in 1 and 5 Liter sizes.</p>

canna-coco-brick-40l-expanded,CANNA - COCO BRICK (40L EXPANDED),"<h3>DETAILS</h3>
<p>This back contains two bricks that expand to 20L each.  Each brick has a  ""break"" line dividing the brick in half  that allows each brick to be divided into 2-10L bricks if desired.  So this means you can easily divided the 40 L coco into 4-10L sections, 2- 20L sections or 1-40L . </p>
<p>The CANNA COCO brick is the exact same high quality as the loose fill CANNA COCO 50 L bags. This means it is made from the highest quality ingredients. It is washed and buffered, not steam sterilized and RHP certified for horticulture. The buffering process allows CANNA to “pre-program” the medium to a certain age. This ensures the same consistent, high quality medium time after time. The composition of coco components blended together offers the best water-air ratio.</p>
<h3>MULTI FUNCTIONAL PACKAGING</h3>
<p>The packaging of each separate brick is in fact a bag in which the brick is designed to be soaked or wetted. No more extra aids, such as buckets, tubs or containers are needed. Just open the bag, add water and the coco is ready.</p>

<p>To make life easier for the grower, the bag has grip handles which makes it very easy to carry the prepared coco to pots, bags, beds or wherever you want it to go.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
Add clean water (lukewarm water speeds expansion) in steps of .5 to 1L until the coco has fully expanded.  If needed the coco can be loosened by hand to create a more uniform product</p>

<p><strong>The CANNA COCO quality in a brick</strong>
This CANNA COCO brick is the exact same high quality as the much desired loose fill CANNA COCO. This means it is made from the highest quality ingredients. It is washed and buffered, not steam sterilized and RHP certified for horticulture. The buffering process allows CANNA to “pre-program” the medium to a certain age. This ensures the same consistent, high quality medium time after time. The composition of coco components blended together offers the best water-air ratio.</p>
<strong>All of this insures CANNA COCO meets the 4 benchmarks for a quality coco medium;</strong>
<ol>
<li>Physical structure</li>
<li>Chemical stability</li>
<li>Free of weed seeds</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
</ol>

<p>CANNA COCO medium matches perfectly with CANNA COCO nutrients. Due to the special characteristics of coco and the applied washing and buffering process, it is possible for CANNA to combine vegetative and flowering nutrients in one nutrient mix. This means the nutrient can be used throughout the growing cycle and there is no need to worry about the proper time to convert from grow- to bloom nutrients.</p>
